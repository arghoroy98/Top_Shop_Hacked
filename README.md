### Inspiration
As a group of international students from a developing country, we always have to look for the best bang for our buck. This included a lot of product comparison while spending the least of our study time. During covid situations, our problem factored by infinity. Considering the fact that there are more people like us. The idea of TopShop was born.

### What it does
This is a program I am building to find the cheapest price of any item by comparing prices from nearby stores. I am making this program to make shopping more efficient for me, and my roommates, especially in these difficult times. For this demo, I used video game listings from two different stores â€“ Walmart and Toys R Us. The program scrapes the Walmart and Toys R Us Website, creating a database of items. The user can then search for any item and choose the store that has lower pricing.

### How we built it
We had this idea for a while but decided to implement it for HackEd 2021. We used modules such as selenium, sqlite3, and uuid.

### What's next for TopShop
We plan to include as many shops/stores as possible in our database. Moreover, we are thinking of including a feature that recommends stores via automated email about items that aren't available. We hope to have a mobile and web application of this product so that it is more convenient for everyone to use.
